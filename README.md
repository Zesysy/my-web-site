# Ma petite création

Designed to show my work while discovering NextJs:
   - configuration of the application in order to use NextJs
   - addition of a contact form using a Netlify functionality
   - creation of Javascript objects to manage the site data and play with the map() method
   - setting up Netlify to use a domain name and allow redirection
